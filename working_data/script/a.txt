missions_localised_description_mk_taurox_bst_taurox_dual_cleaver_stage1	As the chieftain of a fearsome Minotaur tribe, Taurox proved his superiority over the other creatures of the forest by slaying and devouring them, so much so that the ground beneath his feet was forever damp with the blood of his victims. One night an emissary of the Dark Gods entered the mortal realm, crawling from the remains of one of Taurox's rivals. The Daemon was filled withdark energy, and met the gaze of Taurox with its hollow black eyes. However, before it could open its mouth to speak it had its head ripped off and swallowed whole by the blood-thirsty Doombull. A moment passed, and then Taurox was seized by a terrible vision of a worldfilled with blood and corpses. His body shook and spasmed, he roared andscreamed, until he drew his Rune-tortured Axes and slew every member of his tribe. For a year and a day he rampaged across the land, killing every creature unfortunate enough to get in his way. His kills include Beastmen tribes, witchcovens, caravans of Strigany, Ogre mercenaries, Empire patrols, imperious knights and two-headed Giants.	True

mission_text_text_mk_taurox_objective_BONUS_beastmen_main_ghorros_1_5_description	The fire must spread throughout the world of man as surely as it would spread through a forest; their brittle bodies are the kindling from which this inferno will propagate, until they are reduced to blackened cinders - no more than a blackened mark on the world.

mission_text_text_mk_taurox_objective_BONUS_beastmen_main_ghorros_1_3_description	The herd is a mighty, unruly clamour of untempered wills, furious temperaments and single-minded hatred of mankind.

mission_text_text_mk_taurox_objective_BONUS_beastmen_main_ghorros_1_2_description	What dark and devious machinations do the Bray-Shamans devise? What brutality can the Gorebull wreak?
