Now we are Horned Rat’s favoured, yes-yes!" last_edit_user="bob">Master Vulscreek, most unexpected. |Important time is this. The most holy of bells shall be skitter-leaped onto the device of Doom and Curses, yes-yes. |But I have studied device, not-not for controlling Vortex. |Ahhhh, finally you see the truth. A different purpose it has. |The fabric of reality was torn, and, from the Realm of Ruin, the Skaven’s Horned God visited its creatures. |&quot;Clever child&quot;, it whispered, with the voice of a thousand screeching rats. |The celestial event that weakened the Vortex was of Skaven design. A parody of the true comet. |The Council of Thirteen were architects of this grand manipulation. They ordered the devious contraption built. |Its task complete, and fuel expended, the rocket fell back to the surface. |When the wreckage was discovered, its purpose remained unclear, until now. |It was the catalyst to weaken the Vortex and goad the other races into action. |Every ritual cast, the magic was stolen, absorbed into the Horned Rat’s Bell. |Now soaked in ritual power, the bell will be placed in its great carriage, made by the claws of the scribe’s clan, and moved to Ulthuan’s heart. |If it tolls thirteen times, the Horned God shall emerge from the Vortex. |But there is a cost. |The sacrifice of an entire clan. |The Horned God demands the chosen are made ready. |The Horned One has spoken, and your clan will be eat-fed to him. |You betray this clan. |No-no, this was Council’s desire all along. |See gift... a bell-clapper given to me. |And whichever clan has their blood spilt on it when the bell tolls, will be sacrificed. |Tell your lord, spill blood here. |No! No! |Tell him! Tell him! TELL HIM! TELL HIM! |Council will stop ritual, send… many… clans… |Grey Seer clan give their souls. Now we are Horned Rat’s favoured, yes-yes!</text>
