# Beastmen faction unlocker pack (taurox)

- Adds new faction / Legendary lord for crynsos' faction unlocker
- Submod of https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1358383646 standalone mod

---

Work in progress

faction: `wh2_main_bst_blooded_axe`

---

- Managed to get effect bundles in the frontend to appear properly for the blooded axes tribe, which will be the placeholder faction for Taurox faction.
- Managed to teleport the faction leader to Taurox position in Talabecland

---

- Unable to unlock / lock legendary lords like its done in the standalone. Will have to workaround.
