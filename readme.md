# Beastmen Children of Chaos

Beta.

This mod implements a new Beastmen faction for the Mortal Empires campaign: the
Children of Chaos.

Headed by either Taurox the Brass bull, lead the ruthless herds of Beastmen,
dedicated to the spreading of your will to all lands of the Old World and
beyond.

*Note*: It is still in development and has some rough edges, bugs and features
I'd like to implement but I feel like it is almost ready for me to publish and
get some early feedbacks.

# Features

- New legendary lord: Taurox, the Brass Bull.
- New starting position: Talabecland's Great Forest.
- Custom faction/lord traits
- Custom quest battles for Taurox to unlock his Rune-Tortured Axes.
- Fully functional chapter objectives and victory conditions.
- Beastmen legendary lords (Khazrak, Malagor, Morghur) available for
  recruitment, using the same unlock conditions.

# Taurox, the Brass Bull

Known as the Brass Bull, Taurox is a monstrous engine of destruction,
formed of living brass in the shape of a terrible Doombull, dedicated solely to
the spilling of blood in Khorne's name.

He comes with strong lord/faction traits and character skills for Minotaur
units. Think of him as a Gorebull on steroids.

His skill tree includes the reworked version of JR's Old world skills Overhaul,
with custom and unique traits buffing minotaurs and Taurox himself, including
rank7 skills.

The quest for the Rune-Tortured Axes item is available at rank 8, and features
a little battle in Drakwald Lumber Village (make sure to turn on Drakwald
Lumber Village map mod, otherwise it'll fallback to Morghur's Stave of Corruption map).

**Faction & Lord traits**

- Hero capacity: +1 for Gorebulls
- Unit experience: +2 for Minotaurs
- Upkeep: -35% for Minotaur units (Lord's army)
- Recruitment cost: -50% for Minotaur units (Lord's army)

# Starting positions

Taurox, starts in the heart of Talabecland's great forest. The early game will
focus on fighting the faction of Talabecland, followed by all the
remaining Empire factions. It should feel somewhat similar to Morghur while
still feeling fresh and unique (more so if I manage to implement the scenario
and quest battles I have in mind).

Mid and late game will most likely be more diverse, especially when aiming for
the long campaign victory.

# Custom victory conditions

The conditions to win the campaign with the Children of Chaos faction are
slightly different than the main beastmen faction.

- Short campaign:
  - Usual victory conditions for Beastmen
  - Destroy the Wood Elves in addition to the Empire and Bretonnia.
- Long campaign:
  - Usual victory conditions for Beastmen
  - Destroy all major factions.

# Chapter objectives

For the moment, chapter objectives are following Morghur's one.

In future updates, custom chapter objectives should be implemented, following
the expected path in early, mid, late-game.

Ideally, I'd like it to be a bit more dynamic. Depending on your current
position on the campaign map when one main chapter is completed, the following
chapter should be picked from a set of chapter objectives that is tailored to
the region.

## todo list


- Ghorros: New legendary lord
- 3 more quest battles, 1 for Taurox. 2 for Ghorros.
- Brass armour to add as legendary item for Taurox.
- Final quest battle to implement, should follow the Fall of Man battle.
- Custom chapter objectives for both.
- Fixing bugs
